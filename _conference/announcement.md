Convened to mark the bicentenary of his death, Hayley2020 is the first ever
conference dedicated to writer, scholar and amateur doctor William Hayley
(1745-1820). 

Hugely influential in his time, Hayley is now mostly remembered for persuading
William Blake to move to the Sussex coast, commissioning illustrations and prints
from him and driving him to distraction. But there is much more to the man who
wrote (in verse) a runaway bestseller advising young women on how to attract and
keep a husband, refused the poet laureateship for political reasons, and was the
first person to publish an English translation of a long extract from Dante’s
Inferno.

Join us online on November 12 and 13 for a series of presentations and discussions
about Hayley and his world.

All welcome.
