It’s a week since [Hayley2020](chrg-hayley-letters/conference.md), and I’ve almost recovered… Almost… which means it’s time for a quick reflect (if such a thing is possible, given the nature of reflection) and, more important, for a ton of thank yous: 

So – huge thanks to 

### *Presenters* (in alphabetical order) 
David Bindman, Mark Crosby, George Doji, Sarah Haggarty, Alexandra Harris, Alex Kidson, Susan Matthews, Jason Whittaker, Amina Wright

### *Co-convenors and chairs* (in reverse alphabetical order. Just to mix things up a bit) 
Suzanne Reynolds, Mark Crosby (again) and Naomi Billingsley 

### *Colleagues at the Fitzwilliam Museum without whom Hayley2020 wouldn’t have happened* (in no particular order. Confused yet?)
Dan Pett for our web presence and sage advice throughout; Jo Vine for funding applications; Rachel Sinfield for comms work; Grace Hadley for sorting bookings; Amanda Bluck for setting us up to Zoom
our funders: the Paul Mellon Centre and the Association for Art History. Dora Gee for video transcriptions, other admin support and general care of her mother (ie: me).

### *Everyone who registered*, joined us for our live sessions and/or watched the on-demand video presentations.

We were bowled over by the level of interest. Ninety people registered and each session attracted between 35-50 attendees. Many of those who couldn’t make all the sessions watched the presentations “on demand” in Google Slides.

We were delighted (and – to be honest – a bit surprised) by how well the format worked. Filming the presentations in advance meant 
a) if any presenter’s wifi had failed, we’d still have been able to show their work
b) people could watch them “on demand” 
c) we could include subtitles/transcripts, making presentations more accessible to participants whose internet connections could be unstable, or whose first language isn’t English
and
d) we knew exactly how long each presentation would take, which helped with session planning, enabling us to cover as much ground as possible.

Watching the videos and being able to discuss them with the presenters – most of whom participated throughout Hayley2020 – was fantastic, and a massive privilege. 

Obviously, in two half day sessions, we could only scratch the surface of all the aspects of Hayley’s life, work and circle. In particular, missed a focus on Hayley’s work with, and support for, women writers, which we would have included had not two presenters needed to withdraw for Covid-related reasons. However, that did emerge in discussion, as did the following themes, amongst others:

Patronage: from exploring the extent to which Hayley acted as a patron, to asking what counts as patronage and interrogating the relationship between patronage and commerce?
Hayley’s relationships with artists, how did issues of class play out in those relationships? And exactly how annoying could he be?
Hayley and “melancholy sensibility”: this emerged in presentations relating both Hayley’s scholarship and writing, and his relationship with landscape
Hayley’s libraries: their contents; décor and how he shared his books.

There were of course, loads more questions raised including whether Hayley had pets (answer: yes). How did Blake know how to ride Bruno? Who was the Brotherton who taught Hayley drawing at Cambridge? What do we know about Hayley’s friend Mrs Poole? What were Hayley’s relationships like with the Chichester ecclesiastical community in Chichester (answer: complex – much gossip…)

Anyway, I had a fantastic time, and have started thinking about Hayley2022: sensibility & empathy. Who’s in?

And I’ll leave you with some comments from conferenceparticipants and presenters.

Huge thanks to everyone for joining us!
