### Alex Kidson discusses the ups and downs of William Hayley's friendship with George Romney



#### 1. An introduction to Hayley & Romney's friendship

Hayley's classical education was very useful to Romney, who appreciated his friend's ability to suggest interesting subject matter from obscure literature. Hayley also welcomed Romney to his house in Eartham, West Sussex, where the workaholic painter could relax, recharge his batteries, draw and paint. The pair probably met early in 1776, but Hayley didn't sit for his first portrait until 1777.

#### 2. Romney's Cupid & Psyche cartoons

The original plan was for Romney and Hayley to produce a joint work based on Apuleius's _Cupid and Psyche_. Hayley abandoned the project in favour of his _An Essay on Painting: In Two Epistles to Mr. Romney_, which he thought would be more beneficial to his friend. Romney, however, had already made eight cartoons, of which seven survive, but not in very good condition.
