It’s a week since [Hayley2020](chrg-hayley-letters/conference.md), and I’ve almost recovered… Almost… which means it’s time for a quick reflect (if such a thing is possible, given the nature of reflection) and, more important, for a ton of thank yous. So…

#### Thank you to…

**Presenters** (in alphabetical order: [see our presenter bios page](/conference/biographies) for their details) 

David Bindman, Mark Crosby, George Doji, Sarah Haggarty, Alexandra Harris, Alex Kidson, Susan Matthews, Jason Whittaker, Amina Wright

**Co-convenors and chairs** (in reverse alphabetical order. Just to mix things up a bit) 

Suzanne Reynolds, Mark Crosby (again) and Naomi Billingsley.

**Colleagues at the Fitzwilliam Museum without whom Hayley2020 wouldn’t have happened** (in no particular order. Confused yet?)

Dan Pett for our web presence and sage advice throughout; Jo Vine for funding applications; Rachel Sinfield for comms work; Grace Hadley for sorting bookings; Amanda Bluck for setting us up to Zoom

**Our funders** 

[The Paul Mellon Centre](https://www.paul-mellon-centre.ac.uk/) and the [Association for Art History](https://forarthistory.org.uk/). 

And, of course, **Everyone who registered**, joined us for our live sessions and/or watched the on-demand video presentations, as well as Dora Gee for video transcriptions, other admin support and general care of her rather over-excited mother (ie: me).

We were bowled over by the level of interest. Ninety people registered and each session attracted between 35-50 attendees. Many of those who couldn’t make all the sessions watched the presentations “on demand” in Google Slides.

> "Thank you for organizing this fantastic event and for the friendly atmosphere, I really enjoyed it. The format of the sessions worked very well, and I especially appreciated the presence of subtitles, which allowed us to better follow the recorded papers. Excellent work!"

#### Happy punters!

We were delighted (and – to be honest – a bit surprised) by how well the format worked, and by the enthusiasm with which it was received. 

> "Well done for this!  I learnt a lot. … it was heartening to see academic thoughts being expressed articulately, and hear about research from experts again. It made the world feel reassuringly normal."

Filming the presentations in advance meant 
* if any presenter’s wifi had failed, we’d still have been able to show their work
* people could watch them “on demand” 
* we could include subtitles/transcripts, making presentations more accessible to participants whose internet connections could be unstable, or whose first language isn’t English,
and
* we knew exactly how long each presentation would take, which helped with session planning, enabling us to cover as much ground as possible.

> "Thank you and your team for all your hard work. Yesterday was my first shot at a Zoom meeting and you made it so easy 😁"

Watching the videos and being able to discuss them with the presenters – most of whom participated throughout Hayley2020 – was fantastic, and a massive privilege. 

#### Some themes

Obviously, in two half day sessions, we could only scratch the surface of all the aspects of Hayley’s life, work and circle. In particular, missed a focus on Hayley’s work with, and support for, women writers, which we would have included had not two presenters needed to withdraw for Covid-related reasons. However, that did emerge in discussion, as did the following themes, amongst others:

* Patronage: from exploring the extent to which Hayley acted as a patron, to asking what counts as patronage and interrogating the relationship between patronage and commerce?
* Hayley’s relationships with artists: how did issues of class play out in these? And exactly *how* annoying could he be?
* Hayley and “melancholy sensibility”: this emerged in presentations relating both Hayley’s scholarship and writing, and his relationship with landscape
* Hayley’s libraries: their contents; décor and how he shared his books.

> "I really enjoyed #Hayley2020 .I even caught up on the video presentations I'd missed. Such a pleasure to watch enthusiastic academics sharing learning and ideas in a spirit of collaboration"

#### *A Museum of Relationships* (*AMoR*) pilot demo

It was great fun working with George Doji to show off how much work we've put into the pilot project to digitise, transcribe, annotate and link selected letters from the Fitzwilliam's archive – and brilliant to have so many people at the conference asking us to tell them when the website's live and offering to help us test it. And a couple of representatives from other musuems/art galleries expressed interest in using the technical framework/platform George and Dan are building from Philo van Kemenade's designs!

#### More questions!

There were of course, loads more questions raised including whether Hayley had pets (answer: yes). How did Blake know how to ride Bruno? Who was the Brotherton who taught Hayley drawing at Cambridge? What do we know about Hayley’s friend Mrs Poole? What were Hayley’s relationships like with the Chichester ecclesiastical community in Chichester (answer: complex – much gossip…)

Anyway, I had a fantastic time, and am already pondering *Hayley2022: sensibility & empathy*. 

[Who’s in](mailto:lg579@cam.ac.uk)?

Thanks again to everyone who contributed to making Hayley2020 – the first EVER conference dedicated to the life, work and contexts of William Hayley (1745-1820) – so memorable, even in such difficult times!

> "Many thanks indeed for a fascinating conference.  I particularly liked the films (as opposed to watching reams of Powerpoints one after the other!) and enjoyed the discussions very much too.  It was great to be able to learn about Hayley and the context of his times from such a good range of experts …  Thanks for a really stimulating event – a highlight in a rather dreary, upsetting time."
