Lisa Geeâ€™s PhD involved making a digital biography of William Hayley (1745-1820), designed so readers get to meet him in a way that mimics encountering him in real life. She is the author of Stage Mum and Friends: Why Men and Women Are From the Same Planet, and the editor of Bricks Without Mortar: the selected poems of Hartley Coleridge.
